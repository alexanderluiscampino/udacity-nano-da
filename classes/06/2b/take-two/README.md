This is a redesign of the following graphic from **viz.wtf**:

http://viz.wtf/post/141849303856/the-problem-is-bigger-than-you-see

Problems with this graphic:

* Misleading title. 
* Distracting picture of a football player.
* Dark background.
* Orange is too bright.
* White-on-orange text is hard to read.
* Same problem with all caps.
* Text covering up bars.
* Misaligned numbers.
